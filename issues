RuntimeError: Python is not installed as a framework.
The Mac OS X backend will not be able to function correctly if Python is not installed 
as a framework. See the Python documentation for more information on installing Python 
as a framework on Mac OS X. Please either reinstall Python as a framework,
or try one of the other backends.
==
If the problem is only matplotlib, is worth try to change the backend:

import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('TkAgg')
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])
plt.show()

or

pip install matplotlib==1.4.3
